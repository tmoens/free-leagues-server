Error Handling

Really should .catch wherever possible.  If bad data from the client could cause an SQL error,
you really should write a validator or at least .catch the error on save.  When you do, you
should throw a bad request and fill in the message with something useful that can be shown in
the GUI.

Data Visibility - embryonic

For now, anything that needs it should have an "owner" field that points to an organization.
Then I have a vague idea that a user belongs to an organization and can see anything that
is owned or shared to the user's organization.  If the user adds some object it belongs to
the user's organization.
