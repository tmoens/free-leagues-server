The objects in this folder are used to define schemas for leagues.

An NHL schema might have League->Conference->Division schema
League->Division or League->Group

Regardless of what the levels of groups are called - they are always groups and groups of groups with
generic names that suit that league.

Likewise, there are limitless numbers of scoring schemas out there and if you have to
support them all, you need a way to create objects that have new scoring schemas without
changing your database structures.

So, this is where we create the schemas.
