This directory is for information we are tracking from external systems.

In particular people might use an identifier from an external system belonging to an
external organization.  For example, I might identify myself to the system as 89924
from the PDGA but I may also identify myself as player 1799802 in Tennis Canada's
database.  I might also be a certain person in Google, FaceBook or whatever else.

So one player can have many external identities which might be used by various leagues.

The key objects are "External Organization" and a map from an identifier in a particular
external organization to a person in FreeLeagues.
